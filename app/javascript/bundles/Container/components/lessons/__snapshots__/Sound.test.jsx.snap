        Properties of sound waves
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sound waves are
        <span
          id="text-1"
        >
           longitudinal
        </span>
         waves which means they vibrate in the same direction as the direction of travel. They are produced by vibrating sources, such as speakers. Sound waves can only travel through a solid, liquid or gas medium. They travel fastest in solids, then liquids and slowest in gases. A good model for sound waves is a spring.

        The sections of the sound waves where the particles are pushed together are areas of

           compression
