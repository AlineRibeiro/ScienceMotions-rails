    <p> Refracts light - bends it as it enters the eye </p>

    <p>
      <span id="text-2">Pupil</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark circular opening in the centre of the iris of the eye, which
      varies in size to regulate the amount of light reaching the retina.

    <p>
      <span id="text-3">Conjunctiva</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The mucous membrane that covers the front of the eye and lines the
      inside of the eyelids.

    <p>
      <span id="text-1">Cillary muscle</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Muscles connected to the lens by suspensory ligaments. The adjust the
      shape of the lens to make it more or less curved, so as to increase or
      decrease the refraction of light.

    </p>
    <p> Focuses light onto the retina </p>

    <p>
      <span id="text-3">Retina</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The lining of the back of eye containing two types of photoreceptor
      cells - rods - sensitive to dim light and black and white - and cones
      - sensitive to colour. A small area called the fovea in the middle of
      the retina has many more cones than rods.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span id="text-1">Optic nerve</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      A bundle of sensory neurones at back of eye. It carries impulses from
      the eye to the brain.{" "}
