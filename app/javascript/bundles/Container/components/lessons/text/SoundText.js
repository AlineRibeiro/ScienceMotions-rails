      <h1>Properties of sound waves</h1>
      <p>
        Sound waves are
        <span id="text-1"> longitudinal</span> waves which means they vibrate in
        the same direction as the direction of travel. They are produced by
        vibrating sources, such as speakers. Sound waves can only travel through
        a solid, liquid or gas medium. They travel fastest in solids, then
        liquids and slowest in gases. A good model for sound waves is a spring.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sections of the sound waves where the particles are pushed together
        are areas of
        <span id="text-2"> compression</span>. The sections of the sound waves
        where the particles are further apart are areas of
        <span id="text-3"> rarefaction</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sound waves can be
        <span id="text-1"> reflected</span> to form an echo,
        <span id="text-2"> refracted</span> and
        <span id="text-3"> diffracted</span>.
